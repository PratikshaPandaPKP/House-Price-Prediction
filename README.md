**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on predicting a target variable using multiple machine learning models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and a Neural Network. Each model undergoes training on the dataset and is evaluated based on R2 scores and Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both training and testing sets to gauge their performance.

**Steps Involved:**

The steps involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. For linear models like Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, we fit the data to a polynomial of a specified degree. Decision Tree and Random Forest models are trained by splitting the data into nodes based on feature values. Support Vector Regression utilizes a kernel function to transform the input space, while Ridge and Lasso regression apply regularization to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.

**Model Details:**

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Fits data to a linear equation.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Fits data to a polynomial equation of a specified degree.
- **Decision Tree**: Splits data into nodes based on feature values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees trained on different parts of the dataset.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses a kernel function to transform input space.
- **Ridge Regression**: Applies L2 regularization.
- **Lasso Regression**: Applies L1 regularization.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework that builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially.
- **Neural Network**: Captures complex patterns with layers of neurons and activation functions.

**Performance Evaluation:**

Post-training, the models' predictions are compared against the actual values to calculate R2 scores and MSE. These metrics help in assessing the models' accuracy and generalizability. Finally, the models' results are compared to identify the best-performing model, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions for the given dataset.
