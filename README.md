This project focuses on predicting a target variable using multiple machine learning models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and a Neural Network. Each model undergoes training on the dataset and is evaluated based on R2 scores and Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both training and testing sets to gauge their performance.

The steps involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. For linear models like Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, we fit the data to a polynomial of a specified degree. Decision Tree and Random Forest models are trained by splitting the data into nodes based on feature values. Support Vector Regression utilizes a kernel function to transform the input space, while Ridge and Lasso regression apply regularization to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.

XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework, enhances model accuracy by building an ensemble of decision trees sequentially. The Neural Network model, with its layers of neurons and activation functions, captures complex patterns in the data.

Post-training, the models' predictions are compared against the actual values to calculate R2 scores and MSE. These metrics help in assessing the models' accuracy and generalizability. Finally, the models' results are compared to identify the best-performing model, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions for the given dataset.
